# Bonfire.ExtensionTemplate

A template for creating custom extensions for [Bonfire](https://bonfire.cafe/)

## How to use it
- Clone the repository on your `/forks` folder
```
cd forks
git clone https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire_extension_template.git {your-extension-name-here}
cd {your-extension-name-here} 
```
- Rename all the modules names to match your extension name:
    - Find & replace Bonfire.ExtensionTemplate -> Bonfire.YourExtensionName 
    - Find & replace bonfire_extension_template -> bonfire_your_extension_name
- Rename the `bonfire_extension_template.exs` config file to match your extension name `bonfire_your_extension_name.exs`
- Add paths to the router if you need it. If you add paths you will need to include the route module on [bonfire-app router module](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire-app/blob/main/lib/web/router.ex#L51) 
- Add extension specific Fake functions
- Add extension specific migrations
- Add extension deps to deps.git and/or deps.hex 
- Delete the bonfire extension template git history and initiate a new .git 
    ```
    rm -rf .git
    git init    
    ```
- Create your empty extension repository on your preferred platform
- Push your local changes
    ```
      git add .
      git commit -m "first commit"
      git create -M main
      git remote add origin {your-remote-repository}
      git push -u origin main
    ```
- Add the extension on your bonfire deps.path to include it in your local development
- Add `use_if_enabled(Bonfire.ExtensionTemplate.Web.Routes)` in your app's `Router` module
- Add the extension on deps.git also (specifying the branch name) to allow others that do not have it in their fork to use it
- Write a meaningful readme
- TADA ðŸ”¥!

### Add your navigation

> **Warning**
> The following pattern is likely to change in the coming period.

Each extension can specify it's own navbar in a quite flexible way, leveraging on 2 macro: `declare_extension` and `declare_nav_link`.


- On your extension homepage call the `declare_extension` macro, specifying the extension name, its icon (that will be mostly used to list the extension with the other active ones) and the default_nav.

```
declare_extension(
      "ExtensionTemplate",
      icon: "bi:app",
      default_nav: [
        Bonfire.ExtensionTemplate.Web.HomeLive,
        Bonfire.ExtensionTemplate.Web.AboutLive
      ])
```

- The views you will include in the `default_nav` section, will be the ones that will be shown on the navigation sidebar. 

- The last step is to call `declare_nav_link` on each of those view/components already specified in declare_extension. 

```
declare_nav_link(l("About"),
    page: "About",
    href: "/bonfire_extension_template/about",
    icon: "typcn:info-large"
  )
```
